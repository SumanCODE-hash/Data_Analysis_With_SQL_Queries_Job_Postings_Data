## Q‑5) Most Optimal Skills to Learn (High Demand + High Salary)
Blend demand and salary to surface skills offering both **job security** and **financial upside**.

```sql
-- Remote‑only, specified‑salary roles, deduplicated by skills_name
WITH skill_demand AS (
    SELECT
        skills_dim.skill_id,
        skills_dim.skills AS Skills_name,
        COUNT(skills_job_dim.job_id) AS skills_demand  --- Aggregate count on job_id in --table skills_job_dim
    FROM job_postings_fact

    INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id --Join --able with job_id
    INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id  --Join table --with skill_id 
    WHERE job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND 
        job_no_degree_mention = FALSE AND
        salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY
        skills_dim.skill_id
),  avg_salary_skills AS (
    SELECT 
        skills_job_dim.skill_id,
        ROUND(AVG(salary_year_avg), 0) AS avg_salary--- Aggregate count on job_id in --table skills_job_dim
    FROM job_postings_fact

    INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id --Join --able with job_id
    INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id  --Join table --with skill_id 
    WHERE job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND 
        salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL AND
        job_work_from_home =TRUE
    GROUP BY
        skills_job_dim.skill_id
)


SELECT
    skill_demand.skill_id,
    skill_demand.Skills_name,
    skill_demand.skills_demand,
    avg_salary_skills.avg_salary
FROM
    skill_demand
INNER JOIN avg_salary_skills ON avg_salary_skills.skill_id = skill_demand.skill_id
WHERE
 skills_demand > 15
ORDER BY
    skills_demand DESC,
    avg_salary DESC
LIMIT 25;

```

**Insights (Q‑5):**
- **Core, high‑demand skills** with strong averages: **Python** (~$101K, 1,485 postings), **R** (~$100K, 910), **Oracle** (~$105K, 272), **Azure** (~$111K, 236), **AWS** (~$108K, 223), **Snowflake** (~$113K, 186), **Looker** (~$104K, 186), **Go** (~$115K, 218).
- **SQL** has the largest demand footprint (2,368) with an average just under $100K — essential for market reach, even if not the absolute top paying.
- **Visualization tools** such as **Tableau** (~$99K, 1,354) remain near‑optimal due to breadth of demand, especially when paired with Python and cloud skills.

**Recommended learning paths**
- **Data Foundations**: SQL → Excel → BI (Tableau/Power BI)
- **Analyst‑to‑Engineer Lift**: Python → Pandas/NumPy → Airflow → Snowflake/Azure/AWS
- **Analytics Engineering**: SQL + dbt‑style modeling + Git/GitLab/Bitbucket

# What I Learned
- **Advanced SQL patterns**: multi‑CTEs, careful GROUP BY alignment, and consistent filters across CTEs (e.g., remote‑only).
- **Analytical framing**: mapping business questions to precise SQL, then translating results into executive‑ready insights.
- **Market synthesis**: balancing demand metrics with compensation to prioritize learning investments.

# Conclusions
### Insights
1. **Top‑pay roles** concentrate in senior/principal/director tracks and span multiple industries.
2. **SQL** is the baseline for employability; **Python** and **Tableau/Power BI** boost both pay and scope.
3. **Cloud & big‑data tooling** (Snowflake, Azure, AWS, PySpark) correlates with higher salary bands.
4. The **most optimal** upskilling strategy layers **SQL + Python + BI** first, then adds **cloud/engineering** capabilities.

### Closing Thoughts
This step‑by‑step SQL‑driven analysis provides a professional blueprint for prioritizing skills and opportunities in remote Data Analyst roles. Use it to guide learning paths, update portfolios, and target high‑value postings with confidence.
