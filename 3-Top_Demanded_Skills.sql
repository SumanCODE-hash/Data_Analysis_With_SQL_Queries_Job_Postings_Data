üí° Key Insights

SQL = Universal Language ‚Üí #1 for Analysts, #2 for Scientists ‚Üí mandatory for both paths.

Python is the major divider ‚Üí critical for Data Scientists (111k demand vs 40k for Analysts).

Excel & Power BI ‚Üí Analyst staples (not in top scientist stack).

R & SAS ‚Üí Still relevant for Data Scientists (stats-heavy/legacy enterprise).

Visualization (Tableau) ‚Üí Shared skill, but slightly higher demand for Analysts (business context).
